PYTHON TESTS FOR REST API

This is another coding exercise results following lessons I took from JOSE SALVATIERRA'S AUTOMATED SOFTWARE TESTING WITH PYTHON in UDEMY.

The tests include verifying api calls for 3 app versions dealing with database transactions.

They are built with Flask, Flask-RESTful, Flask-JWT, and Flask-SQLAlchemy.

There are sets of tests for each application. For context, folders are created as follows:

App 1 : simple app to demo CRUD - part1 subfolder

App 2 : simple app to demo Relational tables and foreign keys - part2 subfolder

App 3 : app extends app 1 and 2 to add User Registration and tests verifies results of get/post calls - part3 subfolder

Tests for each app are in their corresponding folders as mentioned above.
